# CSE499_A-Comparative-Study-of-ML-Algorithms-for-Detecting-ASD

## About Project
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a developmental impairment caused by brain differences. ASD patients may have a recognized difference, such as a genetic disease. Autism can be diagnosed at any age and is referred to as a "behavioral disorder" since symptoms often develop within the first two years of life. In this study, we have implemented different classifier algorithms such as Decision Tree Classifier, Logistic Regression, and Multi-layer Perceptron classifier (MLP Classifier) for detecting ASD in three types of people - adults, adolescents, and children. The proposed techniques are evaluated on publicly available three different non-clinically ASD datasets. After applying various machine learning techniques and handling missing values, results strongly suggest that ANN-based prediction models work better on all these datasets with higher accuracy of 98.58%, 98.30%, and 95.24% for Autistic Spectrum Disorder Screening Data for Adults, Children, and Adolescents, respectively.
